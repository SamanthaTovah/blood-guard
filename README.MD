# Blood Guard – Raven Guard Successor Chapter

A Raven Guard successor, the Blood Guard are the faceless executioners of the Imperium.  
Their doctrine is built around **the Red Eye**, a symbol of **absolute judgment, merciless efficiency, and the eradication of weakness.**  
They strike with **surgical precision**, eliminating threats before they fester into war.

## 🎨 Armor Colors
- 🔴 **Deep Blood Red Armor** → Matte and battle-worn.
- ⚫ **Black Trim, Gauntlets, and Some Backpacks** → Minimalist **stealth elements.**  
- 🔴 **Mostly Blood Red Backpacks** → Keeps a **unified, striking aesthetic.**  
- ⚫ **Black Chest Plates for Phobos Units** → Enhances their **executioner and stealth aesthetic.**  
- ⚪ **White Armour for Chaplains** → Makes them **distinct from battle line units**.
- 🔵 **Apothecaries (if ever added)** → Would perhaps be **Dark Blue** (matching Fire Support) instead of white, to ensure visual distinction from chaplains.

## 👁 Left Shoulder Pad: **The Red Eye**
- **Placed on the Left Shoulder Pad.**  
- **White on red** for **high contrast and readability.**  
- **Red on white** where free-hand is possible.

## 🛡 Right Shoulder Pad: **Battle Role Colors**
Each unit’s **battlefield role** is clearly marked by its **right shoulder pad color**, making them easy to distinguish while maintaining **cohesion**.

| **Right Shoulder Color** | **Unit Type** |
|-----------------|----------------|
| 🔴 **Blood Red** | Battleline Units (Intercessors, Assault Intercessors, Jump Pack Assault Intercessors, etc) |
| ⚪ **White** | Veterans & Leaders |
| ⚫ **Black** | Scouts & Phobos Units |
| 🔵 **Dark Blue** | Fire Support (Hellblasters, Eradicators, Infernus Squad, etc) |

- **No gold anywhere** (ensures they don’t resemble Blood Angels).

## ⛑️ Helmet Colors: **Rank & Role**
Every Blood Guard warrior wears a **Corvus Beakie helm,** reinforcing their **faceless, executioner identity.**  

| **Helmet Color** | **Unit Type** |
|---------------|--------------|
| 🔴 **Blood Red Beakies** | Battleline Units (Intercessors, Assault Intercessors) |
| ⚫ **Black Beakies** | Sergeants (subtle distinction without disrupting uniformity) |
| ⚪ **Bone-White Beakies** | Veterans, Lieutenants, Captains, HQs (marking them as enforcers of the Red Eye) |
| ⚫ **Black Helmets with White Beak ONLY** | Stealth Units (Reivers, Phobos Librarians, Incursors, Eliminators) |

---

### 🔎 **Reivers & Phobos Units**
- **Black Helmets with only the Beak painted White.**  
- Gives them a **"death mask" executioner look** while keeping them **stealthy.**  
- Makes them **more intimidating** as terror operatives.  

---

### 🔎 **Chaplains**
- **Bone-white armor AND helmets** → Unlike Codex Astartes Chaplains, **Blood Guard Chaplains are the Red Eye’s High Enforcers, more feared than honored.**  
- **This ensures they stand out, appearing as terrifying figures of judgment.**  

---

## 💀 **Bird Skulls: Aesthetic, Not Uniform**
- **Not part of every model**—instead, **used sparingly** on:  
  - **Veterans**  
  - **Reivers / Red Stalkers**  
  - **Sergeants / Character models**  
- **Represents warriors who have carried out extreme purges or executions.**  
- **Sometimes mounted on armor, sometimes hung from belts or weapons.**  

---

## 🤖 **Vehicles & Dreadnoughts**
- **🔴 Deep Blood Red armor with ⚫ black paneling.**  
- **👁 White Red Eye insignia on hulls.**  
- **⚫ Black gun barrels, exhausts, and weapon mounts.**  
- **Minimal extra markings** → To maintain their **ominous executioner aesthetic.**  

---

## 🩸 **Blood Guard Identity & Theme in a Nutshell**
✅ **100% visually distinct from Blood Angels** → No gold, no bright red, **just ruthless executioners in deep red and black.**  
✅ **Ranks & roles clearly defined** → **Helmet & shoulder pad colors** provide clear battlefield differentiation.  
✅ **Stealth units retain a terrifying assassin look** → **Black helmets, white beaks make them pure nightmare fuel.**

✅ **Chaplains in bone-white armor appear as truly terrifying figures of judgment.**  
✅ **Mostly Blood Red Backpacks** → Keeps the army **unified while maintaining contrast.**
