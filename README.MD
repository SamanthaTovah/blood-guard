A Raven Guard successor, the Blood Guard are the faceless executioners of the Imperium. Their doctrine is built around the Red Eye, a symbol of absolute judgment, merciless efficiency, and the eradication of weakness. They strike with surgical precision, eliminating threats before they fester into war.

🎨 Armor Colors
🔴 Deep Blood Red Armor → Matte, battle-worn, and distinct from Blood Angels.
⚫ Black Trim, Gauntlets, and Some Backpacks → Minimalist stealth elements.
🔴 Mostly Blood Red Backpacks → Keeps a more unified, striking aesthetic.
⚫ Black Chest Plates for Phobos Units → Enhances their executioner and stealth aesthetic.
👁 Chapter Symbol: The Red Eye
Placed on the Left Shoulder Pad.
White on red for high contrast and readability.
🛡 Right Shoulder Pad: Battle Role Colors
Each unit’s battlefield role is clearly marked by its right shoulder pad color, making them easy to distinguish while maintaining cohesion.

Right Shoulder Color	Unit Type
🔴 Blood Red	Battleline Units (Intercessors, Assault Intercessors, Jump Pack Assault Intercessors)
⚪ White	Veterans & Leaders (Bladeguard, Lieutenants, Captains, HQs)
⚫ Black	Stealth & Phobos Units (Reivers, Librarians in Phobos, Incursors, Eliminators)
🔵 Dark Blue	Fire Support (Hellblasters, Eradicators, Infernus Squad, Heavy Bolters)
⚪ Bone-White	Chaplains ONLY (High Enforcers of the Red Eye)
No gold anywhere (ensures they don’t resemble Blood Angels).
Apothecaries (if ever added) → Would be Dark Blue (matching Fire Support) instead of white, keeping the purist, executioner aesthetic.
🪖 Helmet Colors: Rank & Role
Every Blood Guard warrior wears a Corvus Beakie helm, reinforcing their faceless, executioner identity.

Helmet Color	Unit Type
🔴 Blood Red Beakies	Battleline Units (Intercessors, Assault Intercessors)
⚫ Black Beakies	Sergeants (subtle distinction without disrupting uniformity)
⚪ Bone-White Beakies	Veterans, Lieutenants, Captains, HQs (marking them as enforcers of the Red Eye)
⚫ Black Helmets with White Beak ONLY	Stealth Units (Reivers, Phobos Librarians, Incursors, Eliminators)
⚪ Bone-White Helmets	Chaplains (serving as High Enforcers of the Red Eye doctrine)
🔎 Reivers & Phobos Units:

Black Helmets with only the Beak painted White.
Gives them a "death mask" executioner look while keeping them stealthy.
Makes them more intimidating as terror operatives.
🔎 Chaplains:

Bone-white armor AND helmets → Unlike Codex Astartes Chaplains, Blood Guard Chaplains are the Red Eye’s High Enforcers, more feared than honored.
This ensures they stand out, appearing as terrifying figures of judgment.
💀 Bird Skulls: Aesthetic, Not Uniform
Not part of every model—instead, used sparingly on:
Veterans
Reivers / Red Stalkers
Sergeants / Character models
Represents warriors who have carried out extreme purges or executions.
Sometimes mounted on armor, sometimes hung from belts or weapons.
🤖 Vehicles & Dreadnoughts
🔴 Deep Blood Red armor with ⚫ black paneling.
👁 White Red Eye insignia on hulls.
⚫ Black gun barrels, exhausts, and weapon mounts.
Minimal extra markings → To maintain their ominous executioner aesthetic.
🩸 Blood Guard Identity & Theme in a Nutshell
✅ 100% visually distinct from Blood Angels → No gold, no bright red, just ruthless executioners in deep red and black.
✅ Ranks & roles clearly defined → Helmet & shoulder pad colors provide clear battlefield differentiation.
✅ Stealth units retain a terrifying assassin look → Black helmets, white beaks make them pure nightmare fuel.
✅ The Red Eye & bird skulls reinforce their role as Imperial enforcers, not just warriors.
✅ Chaplains in bone-white armor appear as truly terrifying figures of judgment.
✅ Mostly Blood Red Backpacks → Keeps the army unified while maintaining contrast.
